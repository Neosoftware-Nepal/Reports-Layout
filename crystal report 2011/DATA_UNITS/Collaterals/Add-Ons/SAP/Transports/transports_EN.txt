There are two sets of transport files, which can be used with BusinessObjects Enterprise Integration Kit for SAP. One set is ANSI and the other set is Unicode enabled. 

The set of transports you must use depends on the BASIS system your SAP system is running on. Additionally, each transport consists of a data file and a cofile, which are listed in brackets behind the transport names.

If your SAP system is running on a BASIS system earlier than 6.20, you must use the files listed below:

(These files are ANSI.)

* Open SQL Connectivity transport (K900128.r22 and R900128.r22)
* Info Set Connectivity transport (K900121.r22 and R900121.r22)
* Row-level Security Definition transport (K900122.r22 and R900122.r22)
* Cluster Definition transport (K900123.r22 and R900123.r22)
* Authentication Helpers transport (K900124.r22 and R900124.r22)



If your SAP system is running on a 6.20 BASIS system or later, you must use the files listed below:
